## üöÄ Overview

This project aims to classify whether a loan applicant is eligible for **loan approval** using **machine learning algorithms**. The model predicts loan approval status based on the applicant‚Äôs **financial profile** and **credit history**.

üîó **Live App:** [Loan Classification Web App](https://loan-classification-production.up.railway.app/)

## üß† Features

* Clean and intuitive **web interface**.
* End-to-end ML pipeline:

  * Data preprocessing & cleaning
  * Model training & evaluation using LightGBM
  * REST API for model inference using **FastAPI**
* Dockerized for smooth and scalable deployment.
* Hosted live via **Railway**.
